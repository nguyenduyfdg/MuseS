It was completed in 1910, and is in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. The artwork displays brown as its prominent color, with dimensions 100.5 cm x 73 cm.

The painting depicts Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who owned an art gallery in France.

Gifted by Mrs. Gilbert W. Chapman in memory of Charles B. Goodspeed in 1948 to Art Institute of Chicago.

Jonathan Jones of The Guardian called the work "probably the greatest work of modern art currently on view in London", mentioning it as an example of how Picasso "demolished everything people had believed a portrait to be for the past 2,000 years or so."
